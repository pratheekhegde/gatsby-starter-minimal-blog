I'm Pratheek Hegde, a software engineer working remotely in Bangalore. I love to build and break things and I get intrigued and fascinated by observing and understanding everything that happens around me. History, Physics, Math, Geography, Space are my interests despite being bad at it.

I have been working on the web since my college days so whatever I know revolves around web technologies like js, node, ts, react, etc.

I'm curious by nature so I keep going the rabit hole on any subject that seems interesting.
